Redlife is a web-based platform that connects blood donors with blood banks. It utilizes Google Maps and geocoding API to help donors locate nearby blood banks, schedule appointments, and check the availability of blood products. Blood banks can update their inventory, and the system sends alerts to the staff when the inventory level is low.
