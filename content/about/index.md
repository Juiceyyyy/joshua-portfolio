Hey! I'm Joshua MenezeS, from Mumbai, also known as 'The City Of Dreams'.

I am a curious, creative, and dedicated individual with strong moral values and ethics, excellent communication, team management, and leadership skills.

I am pursuing my Bachelors Degree from [DBIT, MUMBAI](https://www.dbit.in/) in Computer Engineering (2021-2025) with Honors/Minors in CyberSecurity.

I am currently the Vice-Chairperson of [ACM-DBIT Student Chapter](https://dbit.acm.org/) and also have been an active contributor towards [TEKNACK GAMING STUDIOS](https://teknack.in/https://teknack.in/) for the past three years.

Here are a few of the other activities that I love to do!
